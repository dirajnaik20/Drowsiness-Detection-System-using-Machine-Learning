# Drowsiness Detection System using Machine Learning and Computer Vision 🚗💤

Welcome to the DriverAlert System repository! This project aims to enhance road safety by alerting drivers when they show signs of drowsiness or distraction. Powered by cutting-edge technology, including Raspberry Pi and machine learning algorithms, this system is your trusted co-pilot on the road.

## Overview 📝

Driver fatigue is a leading cause of accidents worldwide, resulting in countless mishaps and casualties. The DriverAlert System offers a proactive solution to combat this issue. By leveraging a combination of hardware and software, it monitors the driver's behavior and alerts them when signs of drowsiness or distraction are detected.
